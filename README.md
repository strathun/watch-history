# watch-history

Work in progress...
Building a tool that will pull all of the user's watch history from their streaming sites and plot it over time. It helps me to remember what was happening in my life by remembering what shows I was watching at the time. 

Eventually, users should be able to add their login information for each site in login_info.csv which will then be pulled in to complete the login to avoid hard coding these into the scripts. Will need to add specific commands for each individual site.
